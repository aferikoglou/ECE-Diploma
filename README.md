# Kubernetes GPU Scheduling

In this project we try to create a GPU Kubernetes scheduler and compare it with the Default Kubernetes GPU scheduler extension and the Alibaba GPU sharing scheduler extension.

In __system-setup__ folder the instructions of setting up the system I have used can be found.

Our custom scheduler is based on [Kube-Knots](docs/papers).

> The container images that are used can be found in my [Dockerhub account](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=aferikoglou&type=image).
